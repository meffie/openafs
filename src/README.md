Guide to the OpenAFS source tree
================================

This is a guide to the various directories in the OpenAFS source code tree.
Some directories contain source code for components of the OpenAFS system,
while other directories are used by the build system to build libraries, kernel
modules, and program variations. See the `Makefile` at the top of the project
tree for build order and inter-dependencies.
